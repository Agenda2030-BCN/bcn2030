They cannot be used to identify you personally.\n\nThese pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:\n\n\n  enabling a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to give the same information several times during one task\n  recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested\n  measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast\n\n\nYou can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through internet browser cookies – what they are and how to manage them.\n\nOur use of cookies\nImportant information about this list of cookies:\n\nThis list may not always be complete.

In these cases, the label “Not applicable” is used.\n\n\nIn the event of adding fresh information to the status of an indicator or to data collection, this will be highlighted in the header of the indicator page.\n\nHow often will the data be updated on the web?\nIt should be noted that the data sources that feed the indicators have very different origins, calendars and periodicities. The indicators are updated individually as new information becomes available.\n\nWhat can be done to avoid the lack of data or the little disaggregation provided?\nThere are indicators that are available at national, regional, provincial or metropolitan level, but not at the level of the core city.\n\nThis implies continuing to work on the search or creation of new data sources to solve this problem.\n\nHow accessible is this website?\nThe intention is to make this website as accessible as possible to all users. Work is underway to pass the accessibility test of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0).\n\nWhich browsers can I use to visit this website?\nAny of the latest versions of commonly used browsers can be used.\n\nCan other cities copy this site?\nYes. This website has been built and hosted using 100% free software. Therefore, other cities can freely reuse its code.
